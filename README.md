<p>Getting banned from Marvel Rivals can feel like being knocked out by Thanos—totally unfair and frustrating, especially if you’re pretty sure you didn’t snap any rules. This quick guide will help you understand why you might have been banned and how to appeal like a true hero to get your account back in action.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban come crashing in right after you made a new account, or does it follow you no matter which hero you pick? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Marvel Rivals has tagged your PC hardware as villainous, making it tough to jump back into the game with any new accounts.</p>

<p>Using an HWID spoofer can help you respawn in Marvel Rivals if your hardware got blacklisted.</p>

<li>Toxic or harassing behavior (even superheroes have a code)</li>
<li>Account sharing or suspicious shenanigans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Always check the Marvel Rivals Terms of Service before launching an appeal.</p>

# How to Get Unbanned from Marvel Rivals (2025 Guide) 🦸‍♂️🛡️

Getting banned from Marvel Rivals can feel like being knocked out by Thanos—totally unfair and frustrating, especially if you’re pretty sure you didn’t snap any rules. This quick guide will help you understand why you might have been banned and how to appeal like a true hero to get your account back in action.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban come crashing in right after you made a new account, or does it follow you no matter which hero you pick? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Marvel Rivals has tagged your PC hardware as villainous, making it tough to jump back into the game with any new accounts.

Using an HWID spoofer can help you respawn in Marvel Rivals if your hardware got blacklisted.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Peek at any emails or in-game notifications from Marvel Rivals or its publisher to find out why you got benched. Common ban reasons include:
- Cheating or third-party hacks (don’t make Deadpool angry)
- Toxic or harassing behavior (even superheroes have a code)
- Account sharing or suspicious shenanigans

**Pro tip:** Always check the Marvel Rivals Terms of Service before launching an appeal.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you call in reinforcements (aka contact support), gather your info:
- Your Marvel Rivals account email address  
- Your in-game username or handle  
- The date your account was banned  
- Any screenshots or error messages
